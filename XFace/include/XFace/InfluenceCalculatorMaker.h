	Implementation of "Pluggable Factory" design pattern. This class is responsible
	for creation of IInfluenceCalculator derived classes. Note that it is an abstract base class, 
	you should always derive a class and implement InfluenceCalculatorMaker::makeInfluenceCalculator 
    function with proper return value specialization for correct IInfluenceCalculator type.
	
	An IInfluenceCalculator derived class must always have a InfluenceCalculatorMaker derived class complementing
	it. XFaceEd automatically adds available IInfluenceCalculator derived classes to its
	influence set and exposes it to the end user. In addition, only this way the core library can 
    use the influence calculation mechanism properly, for utilizing correct influence calculator.

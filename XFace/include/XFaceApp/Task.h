	TaskDictionary class stores the list of Task types, and serve other classes as a 
	dictionary to check. You can query the existance of a Task type, get the number of 
	parameters, and also add new Task types on the fly to extend the capabilities of
	the library. Note that, TaskDictionary is a singleton and a monolithic class with all 
	member functions being static, therefore you can only have one dictionary of tasks 
	per application instance.

	Here is the list of currently available Task types and their meanings;
	- \b RESUME_PLAYBACK \n
	Starts the playback of the currently loaded FAP file. 
	\sa ApplicationBase::onResumePlayback
	- \b STOP_PLAYBACK \n
	Stops the playback and rewinds the FAP file to the beginning. 
	\sa ApplicationBase::onStopPlayback
	- \b PAUSE_PLAYBACK \n
	Pauses the playback.
	\sa ApplicationBase::onPausePlayback
	- \b REWIND_PLAYBACK \n
	Rewinds the playback. 
	\sa ApplicationBase::onRewindPlayback
	- \b RENDER_FRAME \n
	Renders the current frame.
	\sa ApplicationBase::onRenderFrame
	- \b ADVANCE_FRAME \n
	Advances the frame
	\sa ApplicationBase::onAdvanceFrame
	- \b LOAD_FAP \n
	Loads FAP
	\sa ApplicationBase::onLoadFAP
	- \b LOAD_WAV \n
	Loads WAV
	\sa ApplicationBase::onLoadWAV
	- \b LOAD_FDP \n
	Loads FDP
	\sa ApplicationBase::onLoadFDP
	- \b LOAD_PHO \n
	Loads PHO
	\sa ApplicationBase::onLoadPHO
	- \b UPLOAD_FAP \n
	UpLoads FAP
	\sa ApplicationBase::onUpLoadFAP
	- \b UPLOAD_PHO \n
	UpLoads PHO
	\sa ApplicationBase::onUpLoadPHO
	- \b UPLOAD_SCRIPT \n
	Uploads script
	\sa ApplicationBase::onUpLoadScript
	- \b UPLOAD_WAV \n
	Used currently in a bad way, send filename and size of WAV file as parameter, and then after sending the Task, send the WAV file
	in binary from the same communication port. Specific to XfacePlayer only for the moment. 
	\todo Should implement a better way to upload binary files first to implement this (UPLOAD_WAV) Task, note that it 
	is also necessary to be able to upload binary (compressed) FAP files.
	- \b UPLOAD_ANIM \n
	UpLoads ANIM file created by SMIL-Agent (temporary addition)
	\sa ApplicationBase::onUpLoadANIM
	- \b LOAD_ANIM \n
	Loads ANIM file created by SMIL-Agent (temporary addition)
	\sa ApplicationBase::onLoadANIM

/*!
	\brief Task abstraction
	\ingroup XFaceApp
	\author Koray Balci

	For controlling Xface, clients have one of two ways. First is the use of classes implemented
	as usual, and the second is using the Task mechanism. We define a set of Task types, and this 
	class stores the properties of these tasks. Every Task object has a name, set of parameters, 
	an ID and owner ID. Name is a string representing the actual role of the object. You can find
	more information about Task names/types in TaskDictionary class documentation. Every Task object
	has also a set of string parameters depending on the Task type it belongs to. ID is supposed to
	be a unique number representing the Task instance. It might have been assigned automatically 
	during construction, but we chose it to be assigned externally for the time being. Owner ID 
	represents the thread/application which has created and issued this task to Xface. This value 
	is used for feedback notification (more on this: Notification class) mechanism.

	Here is a sample of usage from XfaceClient, where we issue a "resume playback" task through TCP/IP;
	\code
	// we create a task with the client Id and a unique task ID.
	Task task("RESUME_PLAYBACK", m_clientId, ++m_taskCount + 1000000*m_clientId);
	// following function translates the Task to XML string 
	std::string msg = XMLUtils::xmlify(task);
	// Here we send the string through network
	m_pSocket->Write(msg.c_str(), msg.size() + 1);
	\endcode

	On the other hand, if this is a standalone application, or we have direct access to 
	XFaceApp::TaskHandlerBase derived class, we can issue the Task as follows;
	\code
	Task playtask("RESUME_PLAYBACK");
	m_pApp->newTask(playtask);	// m_pApp is a pointer to a TaskHandlerBase derived class instance.
	\endcode

	Note that, we do not have to (and in fact should not) pass owner id and task id for the Task object, 
	because, it is defaulted to 0, and this way we prevent creating/sending Notification messages.
	After all, the latter use is only for the thread that has access to the TaskHandlerBase class. A class
	derived from TaskHandlerBase, tailored for your own purposes can implement event notification 
	mechanism much more efficiently. 
	
	\b Future: In the future versions, we can add plenty of things to this mechanism. Parameters 
	can be in types other than string. ID can be assigned automatically and invisibly, however
	this can create a set of new problems, not sure.. And finally, we can implement a whole class
	hierarchy instead of using strings for naming Task types. For the time being, the system is 
	sufficient for our needs.

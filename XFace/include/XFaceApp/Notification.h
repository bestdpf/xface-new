	Notification objects are used for communication between the client and the server. 
	Server always sends	clients messages as Notification objects translated to XML strings.
	Every Notification object represents the status of a Task object (only ERROR notification
	is a small exception to that). So, owner and task ID properties are the same as of Task object's.

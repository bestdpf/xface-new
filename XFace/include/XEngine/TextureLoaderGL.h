	\version 1.0
	\date   August 2002

	Loads the textures from files (later might create textures dynamically) using
	OpenGL function calls and stores the texture list. Deletes the textures on exit.
	An STL list is used to store the textures.

	\note Do NOT destroy the instance of this class if you still want to use the 
	textures created by it. It DELETEs all the textures created by this instance.

	In the framework, it is used in TextureManager class as a member variable. So, 
	if possible use TextureManager to load/unload and manage your textures.

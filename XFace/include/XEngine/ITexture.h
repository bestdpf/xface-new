	Serves as a base class for texture mapping. Stores the texture name and ID,
	ITexture instances are created in ITextureLoader interface and registered
	to TextureManager using TextureManager::load() member.
	
	Each instance should be named whit a unique string and registered to TextureManager
	for consistent behaviour.

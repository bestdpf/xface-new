TODO
- FAP viseme and emotion processing. With the help from Twente team, implement it fully. FAP and keyframe animation can perhaps be united over anim files?
- implement a test application that will force XfacePlayer to its limits, it will run for days and send various scripts. I will log whatever happens and try to increase stability.
- Bug in ms timing decoding.
- Eye movements are now fixed, but hardcoded eye pivot. Move it to fdp file somehow. (DONE v0.95)
- Save smil scripts from within editor. (DONE v0.91)
- Head Movements in SMIL. (DONE v0.91)
- Action only (without <speech>) scripts. (DONE v0.90)

- we are changing filenames in scriptProcs -> IScriptProcessor, creates problems, should be removed.
- <emotion-display> tag?
- Lots of testing for SMIL.
- For italian scripts, we can have "marks" if necessary. marks can be treated like speech channels, we can process each mark text individiually.
- clever way to support other languages/synthesizers without adding anything in code.

- full support of smil stuff, there are tons of small (easy to implement but ignorable) details in the 
specs, like the whole header part.
- idle eye movements during speech. remember she keeps staring at if we don't force her to look away by script.
- now that the keyframe mode is done, we can move to faps from keyframes and extract faps from the animation.
- documentation of the new things I did (code + external)
- maybe (not needed perhaps) support of mpeg-4 file structure and streaming of faps (encoding/decoding faps during communication, I can perhaps give this to a student here in university as a project).

BUGS FIXED:
v0.90
- If end of animation is eye looking some direction, next script uses that as rest frame. (FIXED v0.90)
v0.91:
- Eye blinking (or anything related to eyes), scripts processed over and over creates 
artifacts, superimposing spoils eye blinker rest frame probably. (Note HALF-FIXED v0.90: we have to have a rest expression 
channel if there is no expression&speech, otherwise eyes still mess up the animation) (FIXED v0.91)
- XfacePlayer: try to "process and send" in client, which is not working actually, then restart client and try 
"send & process", although sound is initially on, behaves as muted, making it off and on once returns it to normal.(FIXED v0.91)
- XfaceClient: process and send button not working properly. (FIXED v0.91)
- MorphChannel::update returning (*m_current)->getEntity() creates eye channel bug or sth like that. (FIXED v0.91)
- morph targets should have begin and end instead of duration, and all will be simpler that way. and some 
bugs will also be prevented such as anger in last part of silent.smil. no more need for trigger channels, etc.. (FIXED v0.91)
- sometimes *.dic files cannot be loaded! HOPEFULLY FIXED v0.91: moved the code somewhere else and made a better implementation)
- MorphChannel::destroy_functor cannot delete the pointer to MorphTarget, crashes the animation. (FIXED v0.91)
- Cannot run XfacePlayer in Debug mode. (FIXED v0.91)
- XfacePlayer: cannot process or play action-only script. (FIXED v0.91) MorphController::reset not called in player code, moved 
that call to AnimProcessor and made it sure it's called in all cases.
- In eye blinking, if the PC is slow (or in debug mode), at the end of blinking eyelids won't go to the starting position but 
end morphing in a middle position. (FIXED v0.91)
- In keyframe mode, stop button during playback crashes.. (FIXED v0.94) m_pCurrTask points to a function variable 
address, when we are out of the function, it goes to limbo state and causes all sorts of problems.
- If there is a missing vrml in mesh targets in fdp file, XfaceEd used to crash, (FIXED v0.94) now it gives a message 
and continues to work. 
- Transformation is not reset when stop button pressed in player, only morph is rewound. (FIXED v0.96)
- Last affect is carried out into other sequential silent behaviour in this script:
<action channel="alice-eyes" action-type="turning" 
	intensity="0.5" dur="2s">
        <parameter>LookLeft</parameter>
  </action>
<speech-animation affect="SmileClosed" 
       dur="2s"/>
  <action channel="alice-eyes" action-type="turning" 
	intensity="0.5" dur="2s">
        <parameter>LookRight</parameter>
  </action>
(FIXED v0.96)

- *dic files are automatically found and parsed. However, now I realize that I might have hardcoded the types in:
std::string SMILManager::getLanguage() const
I have to fix that function, the returned value from getLanguage() is sent to
bool ApplicationBase::onLoadPHO(const std::string& param1, const std::string& param2)
which calls m_pFace->processPhonemes(input, param2); the core of the phoneme processing is actually in here:
int AnimProcessor::processPhonemes(std::istream& input, const std::string& lang) 
(FIXED v0.96)

- Video saving has been reported to have some problems in some graphic cards. (semi FIXED v0.96)

BUGS PENDING:
- Phoneme durations from the phoneme file mismatches with the total duration somehow (speech always longer). The reason is that; if there is a mark in the very beginning, SAPI appends & calculates the silence in the beginning and in the second pass we realize a silence appended, all the speech is thus shifted.
- Cannot save two avi files back to back, cannot remember the codec. So, removed codec remembering code piece for now. 
- Some vrml files cannot be opened properly. There is a difference in the content of vrml tags. see mail 
from Pengcheng Zou for a test vrml.
